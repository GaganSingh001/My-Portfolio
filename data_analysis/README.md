## Project Title 
Dissecting an Insurance Dataset

## Business Drivers and Significance
This analysis is needed to determine the variables that directly affect Customer Lifetime Value(CLV). Understanding these variable will help a company focus on areas that are important.

## Project Overview-
1. Find out what variables are important and eliminate from the dataset variables that are not needed and have no affect on the analysis.
2. Create a Decisions Tree. A decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. As the name goes, it uses a tree-like model of decisions. 
3. Create a Correleation Plot. A correlation plot shows what fields relate most to other fields in the dataset. For instance, budget & profit. We know the the higher the budget the greater the profit. The correlation plot will show that relationship graphically
4. Create a Cluster chart. Building off the previous Correlation plot i will create a cluster diagram using the fields that relate the most and create a cluster diagram to determine if there are any clusters. Knowing what cluster a customer falls in can assists in marketing efforts.  Customers in the same cluster are more like other customers in that cluster.

## Implementation Phases

1. Use R script to subset the dataset set to include only the most important fields.
2. Create scripts for each of the plots.
3. Create a Power Bi visual using the R Scripts developed from #2.

## Features
1. An intuitive dashboard that analyzes and displays key factors that affect CLV.

## Timeline
From start to finish, this script took about 1 weeks to develop. This is dependent on how accessible the customer is to provide feedback.

## Technologies Used
1. R is used for development and Power BI is used for diplaying the data.
