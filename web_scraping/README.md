## Project Title 
Web Scraping & API Integration

## Business Drivers and Significance
Most companies do no have the data necessary to do any type of analysis. This is where web scraping and api integration comes in. Sometimes, youâ€™ve got to go out and get the data you need. The ability to collect unique data sets can really set you apart from the pack, and being able to access APIs and scrape the web for new data stories is the best way to get data nobody else is working with.

## Project Overview- 
Creation of various scripts to pull data from Social Networks (Twitter, Instagram, Youtube) and sites such as Wikepidea, Google Trends, to name a few. Any site with data is a candidate, but for this project, here were the requirements.

1. Wikepedia -  Movies and Movie Details 
2. Twitter, Instagram, Youtube (Books) - Comments
3. Google Trends - Search queries and locations

## Implementation Phases
1. Requirements Gathering
2. Initial Design and User Approval of the Design
3. Development
4. User Acceptance Testing
5. Deployment to Production

## Features
1. Wikepedia dataset of films & film details a .csv file.
2. Twitter, Instagram, Youtube comments output into a bar graph.
3. Google Trend search data into an audience location Bubble Map.

## Timeline
From start to finish, this project took about 4 weeks to develop. This is dependent on how accessible the customer is to provide feedback.
