## Project Title 
1. Predict A Film's Success
2. Predict Job Performance 

## Business Drivers and Significance
1. Before they began producing a film they wanted to predict if the film has a chance of success comparative to historically success similar films.
2. Predict job performance based on attributes of the person being interviewed compared to a list of past employees performance. 

## Project Overview- 
1. Create a model in ML Azure from historical films and their details that will produce an API that will predict future films success.
2. Create a script in R that will create a model that will predict job performance of future applicants compared to historical performance of past employess.
 
## Implementation Phases
1. Preprocess and prepare the data for prediction.
2. Create the models used to make future predictions.
3. Run each file through the prediction engines.
4. Export results in a .csv file.

## Features
1. A script that the user can automatically run that will clean the data and output to the needed format.

## Timeline
From start to finish, this script took about 2 weeks to develop. This is dependent on how accessible the customer is to provide feedback. (The web scraping of the data was a part of a different phase)

## Screenshots

2. [Data After Preprossing](/data_preparation/Film_Dataset_After.csv)

## Technologies Used
1. Used R to create the script to Preprocess the data.
2. The script was created to export the final preprocessws data to a .csv file.
